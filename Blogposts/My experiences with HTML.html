				<h1>My experiences with HTML</h1>
				<br>
				
				<p>Well, anyone who has worked with HTML surely knows one thing. It isn't the hardest thing to do on earth. In fact, web designing using HTML is one of the easiest things to do :P. All you need to do is read the book and apply your own ideas accordingly. Now, you must be wondering, what is so great in this that this chap is posting about it, on his blog.</p>
				
				<p>Let me be very frank here. This is one of the only things I have done in the summers and want to show off regarding the same. In fact, I can also say that this is one of the only things I have done in the entire of my first year of engineering. So, I am just writing this to document how I have designed my first website. :D (A practice I intend to continue for all of my works)</p>
				
				<p>Having read from Wiley's HTML-4 for Dummies (4th Edition), I started reading on this and simultaneously make the site. I have used various HTML tags and have also META-ed my page, with my name as the author and the content (NARCISSIST \m/). Well, what else is left? NOTHING :P That is almost everything about HTML.</p>
				
				<p>Keep watching for better blogs, when I actually do something good :D</p>
